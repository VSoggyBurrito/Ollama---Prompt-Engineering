To ascertain whether Sarah makes it to her flight on time we'll need to calculate each segment of her journey: the
walking duration from home to the bus stop, waiting for an additional delayed bus ride, actual transportation
times and security procedures at the airport before boarding can begin. Let us tackle these one by one while
adhering strictly to provided details in calculations where needed.

1. Walking Duration: Sarah's apartment is 0.5 miles away from the bus stop. Since she walks at a pace of 3 miles
per hour, we calculate her walking time as follows: (distance / speed) = (0.5 miles / 3 mph) which equals
approximately 16.7 minutes to walk there.

2. Bus Waiting Time and Travel Duration: The bus is scheduled at 8:10 AM but arrives late by an additional 8
minutes, so Sarah actually catches the bus at around 8:18 AM (8:10 + 8 min). If we add this to her original
departure time from home of 7:45 AM and subtract it from her flight's boarding start of 9:15 AM (which is,
according to airline rules, 30 minutes prior), the window she needs for bus travel plus security at the airport
before heading to gate starts looking like this:

   Bus Arrival + Security Time = Subsequent Airport Timeline Start Point. We have a total of 58 (bus delay) + 16.7
(walking time from home), which gives us approximately 74 minutes, rounding up for simplicity to say Sarah will
arrive at the bus stop around 9:02 AM after accounting for her walking and waiting times; this means she would
miss not just airport boarding but also the flight's departure as well.

3. Bus Ride Duration & Additional Airport Time: The actual ride takes exactly 50 minutes, adding to our previous
calculated arrival time of around 9:12 AM (74 min + 50 min bus duration), Sarah would have enough time for
security and boarding after this calculation but only just.

Considering these calculations in sequence without accounting for any potential additional delays or unexpected
incidents, we can conclude that while the timing is extremely tight: assuming no further delay occurs during her
transportation to the bus stop (which she controls by leaving home at 7:45 AM), Sarah would just barely make it
through security and get on time if everything runs perfectly according to plan. However, as this schedule
provides virtually zero buffer for any unforeseen events or delays beyond walking duration—and based sole0n our
calculations that she will arrive around the airport's boarding start window with just about no spare minutes in
hand —it would be highly risky and likely result in missing her flight.

In summary, Sarah does not catch her flight as planned because of tight timings without any buffer time for
unexpected events or additional delays during travel segments to the airport from home after walking 0.5 miles at
a pace of 3 mph on foot with an initial bus delay included and subsequent calculations indicating she would miss
boarding by a small margin, if all goes perfectly according to her tight schedule without considering potential
extra hold-ups that could easily disrupt such timings in real life situations.

Let's break down the situation into smaller parts:

1. Walking to the bus stop:
Sarah leaves her apartment at 7:45 AM and walks at a pace of 3 miles per hour. The bus stop is 0.5 miles away. To
find the time it takes her to walk to the bus stop, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 0.5 miles / 3 miles/hour
= 0.167 hours (or approximately 10 minutes)

So, Sarah arrives at the bus stop around 7:55 AM.

2. Bus arrival and delay:
The bus is scheduled to arrive at 8:10 AM, but it's running 8 minutes late. This means the actual arrival time is:

8:10 AM + 8 minutes = 8:18 AM

3. Bus ride to the airport:
The bus ride takes exactly 50 minutes. Since Sarah arrives at the airport around 8:18 AM, we can calculate the
departure time of the bus from the apartment as follows:

Departure time = Arrival time - Bus ride duration
= 8:18 AM - 50 minutes
= 7:28 AM

So, the bus departs from the apartment at 7:28 AM.

4. Time before flight departure:
Sarah's flight departs at 9:45 AM. We need to find out if she has enough time to clear security and board the
plane before departure. She spends 10 minutes going through security, so we subtract that from her total available
time:

Total available time = Flight departure time - Required arrival time (30 minutes before departure)
= 9:45 AM - 9:15 AM
= 1 hour

She has 1 hour to clear security and board the plane. After spending 10 minutes going through security, she has:

Remaining time = Total available time - Time spent in security
= 1 hour - 10 minutes
= 50 minutes

Sarah still has 50 minutes before the flight departs. This is more than enough time for her to clear security and
board the plane.

Conclusion:
Based on these calculations, Sarah will arrive at the airport with plenty of time to spare. She will catch her
flight, and it's unlikely that she'll be delayed due to security or other reasons.

To determine if Sarah catches her flight, we need to calculate the time it takes her to walk to the bus stop, wait
for the bus, ride the bus to the airport, go through security, and arrive at the gate before the flight departs.
We'll use a step-by-step approach to break down the calculation:

Step 1: Walking to the bus stop

Time = Distance / Pace

Distance = 0.5 miles
Pace = 3 miles/hour

Time = 0.5 miles / 3 miles/hour = 0.17 hours (or 10 minutes)

Step 2: Waiting for the bus

Time = Total Time Waited / Number of Minutes Late

Total Time Waited = 8:10 AM - 7:45 AM = 25 minutes
Number of Minutes Late = 8 minutes

Time = 25 minutes / 8 minutes = 3.125 hours (or 20 minutes)

Step 3: Riding the bus to the airport

Time = Distance / Speed

Distance = 5 miles
Speed = 30 miles/hour

Time = 5 miles / 30 miles/hour = 0.167 hours (or 10 minutes)

Step 4: Going through security

Time = Time Spent / Number of People in Line

Time Spent = 10 minutes
Number of People in Line = Unknown

Assuming Sarah is the only one in line, Time = 10 minutes / 1 person = 10 minutes

Step 5: Arriving at the gate

Time = Total Time + Time Spent

Total Time = Walking to the bus stop + Waiting for the bus + Riding the bus to the airport + Going through
security

Total Time = 0.17 hours + 20 minutes + 0.167 hours + 10 minutes = 1.83 hours (or 110 minutes)

Step 6: Arriving at the gate before flight departs

Time = Total Time - Flight Departure Time

Flight Departure Time = 9:45 AM

Total Time = 1.83 hours (or 110 minutes)

Time = 1.83 hours (or 110 minutes) - 9:45 AM = 10:32 AM (or 10 minutes before flight departure)

Based on the calculations above, Sarah does catch her flight. She arrives at the gate at 10:32 AM, which is 10
minutes before the flight departs at 9:45 AM.

To summarize, Sarah catches her flight because she allows enough time to walk to the bus stop, wait for the bus,
ride the bus to the airport, go through security, and arrive at the gate before the flight departs. She carefully
plans her schedule and allows for contingencies such as delays in public transportation to ensure that she arrives
on time.
